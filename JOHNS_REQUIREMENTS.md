# John's Requirements for Cosmex Vein Clinic Lead Generation

## Key Business Model
- We work as an extension of Cosmex Vein Clinic (CVC)
- Lead generation and qualification for two pathways
- Kerry is appointment setter who qualifies leads

## Two Treatment Pathways

### 1. FACIAL VEINS
- Treatment: 980nm laser or IPL
- Cost: £50 consultation and test patch
- No ultrasound needed
- Straightforward booking

### 2. LEG VEINS
**Option A: Proper Approach (Recommended)**
- £250 ultrasound scan + assessment + diagnosis
- Includes duplex doppler function
- 12-MONTH GUARANTEE from treatment date
- Identifies feeder veins to prevent recurrence

**Option B: Budget Approach (Risky)**
- £50 consultation and test patch
- NO GUARANTEE
- Risk of veins reappearing if feeder veins not identified
- Not recommended but available

## Important Notes
- Neither consultation fee is redeemable or refundable
- Ultrasound is highly specialized (Anam is deputy head at John Radcliffe Oxford)
- Without scan, veins often reappear within months due to untreated feeder veins
- The guarantee is a major selling point for the £250 scan
