## CONVERSATION FRAMEWORK BY ROUTE

### Route 1: FACE VEINS â†’ Â£50 CONSULTATION

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is Kerry from Cosmex Vein Clinic. I've just reviewed your assessment about facial veins affecting your [areas]. I have good news - we can definitely help with this..."

**Key Qualifying Questions:**
1. "Have you tried any treatments before for these veins?"
2. "On a scale of 1-10, how much do these affect your daily confidence?"
3. "Are you looking to treat all areas or start with the most bothersome?"
4. "Do you have any events coming up you'd like to look your best for?"

**Booking Approach:**
"For facial veins, you'll see either Cosmex Me or Consi, our specialist aesthetic practitioners. The consultation is Â£50, which includes a detailed skin analysis and patch test. Most patients need 2-3 treatment sessions. Should I check our earliest availability for you?"

**Payment Collection:**
"To secure your appointment, I'll take the Â£50 consultation fee now. This guarantees your slot and goes toward any treatment you decide to have."

---

### Route 2: LEG VEINS â†’ Â£250 DUPLEX SCAN

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is Kerry from Cosmex Vein Clinic. I've reviewed your assessment, and based on your [symptoms/vein type/risk factors], Mr Kahloon, our Consultant Vascular Surgeon, would need to perform a duplex ultrasound scan first..."

**Education Points to Cover:**
- Why scan is essential (see beneath skin)
- What scan reveals (root cause)
- How it ensures correct treatment
- 12-month guarantee on treatments

**Key Qualifying Questions:**
1. "How are your symptoms affecting your daily activities?"
2. "Have you had to change your lifestyle because of your veins?"
3. "Are you aware this might be covered by your health insurance?"
4. "What's your main goal - symptom relief or appearance?"

**Handling Price Concerns:**
"I understand Â£250 seems significant, but this is a comprehensive medical assessment by a Consultant Vascular Surgeon. It's actually the same scan that would cost over Â£500 privately at other clinics. Plus, any treatment following the scan includes our 12-month guarantee."

**Booking Approach:**
"Mr Kahloon has availability next [day] at [time]. This is actually quite rare - he's usually booked 2-3 weeks out. Should I reserve this for you?"

---

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], this is Kerry from Cosmex Vein Clinic. Based on your assessment, you have two options available..."

## OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### "I need to think about it"
"I completely understand. This is about your health and appearance. What specifically would you like to think through? Is it the timing, the investment, or would you like more information about the treatment itself?"

### "It's too expensive"
"I appreciate that it's an investment. Many patients initially feel that way, but then realize they've spent more over the years on compression stockings, creams, and covering up. This is a permanent solution. We also offer payment plans, and many insurance policies cover vein treatment. Should I check what options might work for you?"

### "I'm scared of procedures"
"That's completely natural and actually quite common. The good news is, modern vein treatments are nothing like the old 'stripping' surgeries. Most patients are surprised how comfortable it is. The consultation itself is just an ultrasound scan - completely painless, just like a pregnancy scan. Would it help to know more about what to expect?"

### "I need to check with my partner"
"Of course, it's good to have support. While you discuss it, should I pencil you in for next week? That way you have the appointment if you decide to proceed, but there's no obligation and we only take payment when you're completely ready."

### "Can't I just live with it?"
"You absolutely can, and many people do. However, vein problems typically progress over time. What's cosmetic today can become medical tomorrow. The assessment helps you make an informed decision. Would you prefer to at least know what you're dealing with?"

## UPSELLING & CROSS-SELLING OPPORTUNITIES

### For Face Vein Patients:
- "Have you noticed any thread veins on your legs as well?"
- "We also offer skin rejuvenation treatments that complement vein removal"
- "Many patients book a package of 3 sessions for better value"

### For Leg Vein Patients:
- "If we're treating legs, have you noticed any facial veins?"
- "Partners often book together - does your husband/wife have vein concerns?"
- "We offer a follow-up scan package for peace of mind"

### Insurance Opportunities:
"Do you have private medical insurance? Many policies cover vein treatment when symptoms are present. I can provide the codes you'll need for pre-authorization."

## SAMPLE FULL CONVERSATION

**Kerry:** "Hi Sarah, this is Kerry from Cosmex Vein Clinic. I've just reviewed your assessment about the varicose veins on your legs. How are they feeling today?"

**Sarah:** "Oh hi, yes they're quite achy actually, especially by evening."

**Kerry:** "I'm not surprised - you mentioned you're a teacher, so you're on your feet all day. That definitely makes it worse. The good news is Mr Kahloon, our Consultant Vascular Surgeon, specializes in exactly your situation."

**Sarah:** "Oh good. What would be involved?"

**Kerry:** "Based on your symptoms and the fact you have visible varicose veins, Mr Kahloon would need to do a duplex ultrasound scan first. This shows us what's happening with the valves in your veins - basically why blood is pooling and causing your symptoms."

**Sarah:** "Is that the Â£250 scan?"

**Kerry:** "Yes, that's right. It's a comprehensive medical assessment that takes about 30 minutes. Mr Kahloon does the scan himself and discusses treatment options immediately. If you proceed with treatment, it comes with our 12-month guarantee."

**Sarah:** "That sounds good but it's quite expensive..."

**Kerry:** "I understand. Do you have private medical insurance? Most policies cover this when symptoms are present, which you clearly have."

**Sarah:** "Actually yes, I have Bupa through work."

**Kerry:** "Perfect! We work with Bupa regularly. You'll need to call them for pre-authorization using code I83.0 for varicose veins with symptoms. They usually approve within 24 hours. Should I hold an appointment for you for next week?"

**Sarah:** "Yes, that would be great."

**Kerry:** "Wonderful. I have Thursday at 2pm or Saturday at 10am. Which works better?"

**Sarah:** "Thursday is perfect."

**Kerry:** "Excellent. I'll reserve Thursday at 2pm with Mr Kahloon. Once Bupa approves, we'll confirm everything. If for any reason they don't cover it, we can discuss options. I'll email you the authorization codes and what to tell Bupa. Any other questions?"

**Sarah:** "No, that's been really helpful, thank you."

**Kerry:** "You're welcome Sarah. You're going to be in excellent hands with Mr Kahloon. I'll email everything over now and text you a confirmation. Speak soon!"
