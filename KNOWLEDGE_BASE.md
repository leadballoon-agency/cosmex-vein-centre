# Cosmex Vein Clinic - Complete Knowledge Base

## 1. VEIN CONDITIONS

### Spider Veins (Telangiectasia)
- **Appearance**: Small, thin veins visible through skin (red, purple, blue)
- **Size**: Less than 1mm diameter
- **Common locations**: Face, legs, chest
- **Causes**: Genetics, sun exposure, hormones, trauma
- **Treatment**: Sclerotherapy, laser, IPL

### Varicose Veins
- **Appearance**: Enlarged, twisted, bulging veins
- **Size**: 3mm or larger
- **Common locations**: Legs (calves, thighs)
- **Causes**: Valve failure, genetics, pregnancy, standing
- **Symptoms**: Aching, heaviness, swelling, itching
- **Treatment**: EVLA, foam sclerotherapy, surgery

### Reticular Veins
- **Appearance**: Blue/green veins under skin
- **Size**: 1-3mm diameter
- **Common locations**: Back of knees, thighs
- **Often feed spider veins** (important!)
- **Treatment**: Sclerotherapy, foam sclerotherapy

### Thread Veins
- **Facial**: Often from rosacea, sun damage
- **Leg**: Usually cosmetic concern
- **Treatment**: Microsclerotherapy, laser, IPL

## 2. TREATMENT OPTIONS

### Facial Vein Treatments (£50 Consultation)

#### 980nm Laser
- **Best for**: Individual visible vessels
- **How it works**: Laser energy coagulates blood in vein
- **Sessions needed**: 1-3
- **Downtime**: Minimal, some redness
- **Results**: Immediate vessel blanching, full results in 2-4 weeks

#### IPL (Intense Pulsed Light)
- **Best for**: Diffuse redness, rosacea, multiple small vessels
- **How it works**: Light energy targets hemoglobin
- **Sessions needed**: 2-4
- **Downtime**: Minimal, possible mild swelling
- **Results**: Progressive improvement over sessions

### Leg Vein Treatments

#### Sclerotherapy (£800-1500)
- **Best for**: Spider veins, small varicose veins
- **How it works**: Injection of sclerosant solution
- **Sessions needed**: 2-4
- **Success rate**: 85-90%
- **Downtime**: Compression stockings 1-2 weeks
- **Note**: REQUIRES ULTRASOUND for feeder vein identification

#### EVLA - Endovenous Laser Ablation (£2000-3500)
- **Best for**: Large varicose veins, saphenous veins
- **How it works**: Laser fiber inserted into vein
- **Sessions needed**: 1-2
- **Success rate**: 95-98%
- **Downtime**: Walk immediately, normal activities in days
- **Note**: ALWAYS requires ultrasound guidance

#### Foam Sclerotherapy (£1000-2000)
- **Best for**: Larger reticular veins, small varicose veins
- **How it works**: Foamed sclerosant for better contact
- **Sessions needed**: 2-3
- **Success rate**: 90-95%
- **Note**: Ultrasound essential for mapping

## 3. THE ULTRASOUND DIFFERENCE

### Why £250 Ultrasound is Critical for Leg Veins

#### What Standard Consultation Misses
- Hidden feeder veins (source of problem)
- Valve incompetence locations
- Deep vein thrombosis risk
- Perforator vein issues
- True extent of venous disease

#### Duplex Doppler Ultrasound Shows
- **Anatomy**: Exact vein mapping
- **Flow**: Direction and speed of blood flow
- **Reflux**: How long blood flows backward
- **Competence**: Which valves work/fail
- **Connections**: How veins interconnect

#### Clinical Measurements
- Reflux time (>0.5 seconds = abnormal)
- Vein diameter (>4mm often needs treatment)
- Flow velocity
- Thrombosis presence

### 12-Month Guarantee Explained
- Only with £250 ultrasound scan
- Covers recurrence of treated veins
- Includes follow-up assessment
- Free retreatment if needed
- Why possible: Proper diagnosis = proper treatment

### Without Ultrasound (£50 Only)
- **Success rate**: 40-60% at best
- **Recurrence**: Usually within 2-3 months
- **Why fails**: Feeder veins continue pumping blood
- **Result**: Wasted money, disappointment
- **No guarantee**: We cannot guarantee guesswork

## 4. CEAP CLASSIFICATION (Medical Standard)

### C - Clinical
- C0: No visible veins
- C1: Spider veins/reticular veins
- C2: Varicose veins
- C3: Edema (swelling)
- C4a: Pigmentation/eczema
- C4b: Lipodermatosclerosis
- C5: Healed ulcer
- C6: Active ulcer

### E - Etiology
- Ec: Congenital
- Ep: Primary
- Es: Secondary (post-thrombotic)

### A - Anatomy
- As: Superficial veins
- Ap: Perforator veins
- Ad: Deep veins

### P - Pathophysiology
- Pr: Reflux
- Po: Obstruction
- Pr,o: Both

## 5. RISK FACTORS & RED FLAGS

### Immediate Medical Attention Needed
- Active bleeding from vein
- Sudden severe leg pain with swelling
- Skin ulceration
- Signs of infection (red, hot, fever)
- Suspected DVT (deep vein thrombosis)

### High Priority (See within 1 week)
- Skin changes (darkening, hardening)
- Recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis
- Severe symptoms affecting daily life
- Multiple risk factors present

### Risk Factors for Progression
- Family history (80% genetic)
- Pregnancy (hormones + pressure)
- Obesity (increased venous pressure)
- Standing occupation (teachers, retail)
- Previous DVT
- Age (valves weaken over time)

## 6. PATIENT OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### "£250 for a scan seems expensive"
**Response**: "The scan is performed by Anam, deputy head of vascular science at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital. This isn't a quick look - it's comprehensive medical imaging that takes 30-45 minutes and maps your entire venous system. Without it, we're essentially treating blind."

### "Can't you just treat what you can see?"
**Response**: "Visible veins are like leaves on a tree - the real problem is often the roots (feeder veins) you can't see. Treating surface veins without addressing feeders means they'll return in 2-3 months."

### "Other clinics don't require ultrasound"
**Response**: "That's exactly why we see so many patients who've had failed treatments elsewhere. We could take your money for quick treatment, but we'd rather do it properly once with our 12-month guarantee."

### "I'll try the £50 option first"
**Response**: "You can, but please understand: without ultrasound mapping, any leg vein treatment is temporary. Most patients who choose this option end up paying more in the long run for retreatments."
